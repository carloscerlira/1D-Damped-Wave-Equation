# 1D Damped Wave Equation
An analytical solution for the 1D Damped Wave Equation was found, this equation describes the movement of a string wich is set free from a tension state, using processing a simulation for this problem was made, different parameters can be changed easily to see how they affect the solution.  
The special case where the solution is harmonic was found in the laboratory.
